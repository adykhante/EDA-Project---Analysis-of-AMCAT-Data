# EDA Project - Analysis of AMCAT Data

Welcome to the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) Project focused on the analysis of AMCAT (Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome) Data!

## Introduction
This project is part of my internship at Innomatics Research Labs, where I delve into the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) dataset. Released by Aspiring Minds, this dataset primarily targets students with engineering backgrounds and provides valuable insights into their employment outcomes.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source**: The dataset originates from the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) study.
- **Scope**: Limited to students with engineering disciplines.
- **Variables**:
  - Dependent Variables: Salary, Job Titles, Job Locations.
  - Independent Variables: Cognitive skills, Technical skills, Personality skills, and demographic features.
- **Size**: Contains around 4000 data points.
- **Type**: The dataset comprises both continuous and categorical independent variables.

## Project Goals
- Analyze employment outcomes for engineering graduates.
- Explore trends in salary, job titles, and locations.
- Examine standardized scores in cognitive, technical, and personality skills.
- Investigate demographic features impacting employment.

## Repository Structure
- **Data**: Contains the original dataset and any additional data files.
- **Notebooks**: Includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **Reports**: Stores any reports, findings, or insights derived from the analysis.
